Detailed Explanation:
Initialization of ans1 and ans2:

ans1 = 0 and ans2 = 0 are initialized to keep track of the cumulative XOR of nums1 and nums2, respectively.
Initially, these are set to 0 because XORing with 0 does not affect the result.
First Conditional Block (if (nums2.length % 2 == 1)):

We check if the length of nums2 is odd (nums2.length % 2 == 1).
Why check the oddness of nums2.length?: The reason for this is that each element in nums1 will pair with every element of nums2, resulting in each element of nums1 appearing in the XOR operation an exact number of times equal to nums2.length.
If nums2.length is odd, each element in nums1 will appear an odd number of times in the overall XOR, so their contribution will not cancel out. Hence, we need to XOR all elements in nums1 together.
If nums2.length is even, every element of nums1 will appear an even number of times, which will cancel out its contribution to the final XOR.
If nums2.length is odd, we loop over all elements in nums1, XOR them together and store the result in ans1.
Second Conditional Block (if (nums1.length % 2 == 1)):

We check if the length of nums1 is odd (nums1.length % 2 == 1).
Why check the oddness of nums1.length?: Similarly to the first check, if nums1.length is odd, each element of nums2 will appear an odd number of times in the final XOR operation, so we need to include the contributions of all elements in nums2.
If nums1.length is even, the elements in nums2 will contribute an even number of times, and thus their contribution will cancel out.
If nums1.length is odd, we loop over all elements in nums2, XOR them together, and store the result in ans2.
Final XOR (return ans1 ^ ans2):

After calculating the XOR for nums1 and nums2, we return the XOR of ans1 and ans2.
Why XOR ans1 and ans2?: The final XOR needs to account for both arrays' contributions. If one array's length is odd, its elements will contribute to the final XOR, while the other array's contribution (if its length is even) will cancel out. So, by XORing ans1 and ans2, we get the correct result.
Why Use Odd Lengths?
The key observation in this problem is that if the length of an array is odd, each element in the array will appear an odd number of times in the final XOR of all pairings. Since XORing an element an odd number of times means that element contributes to the final result, we need to include all elements of the array in the XOR operation.

On the other hand, if the length of an array is even, each element in the array will appear an even number of times. Since XORing an element an even number of times cancels out its contribution (because x ^ x = 0), we do not need to include that array in the final XOR calculation.

Example Walkthrough:
Example 1:
Input:

nums1 = [2, 1, 3]

nums2 = [10, 2, 5, 0]

nums1.length = 3 (odd), so we XOR all elements in nums2.

nums2.length = 4 (even), so we do not XOR elements in nums1.

Step-by-step:

XOR all elements of nums2 = [10, 2, 5, 0]:
Copy
Edit
10 ^ 2 ^ 5 ^ 0 = 13
Return the result of XORing the result from nums2 (13) with the result from nums1 (which is 0, since we didnâ€™t XOR nums1):
Copy
Edit
ans1 ^ ans2 = 0 ^ 13 = 13
So, the output is 13.

Example 2:
Input:

nums1 = [1, 2]

nums2 = [3, 4]

nums1.length = 2 (even), so we do not XOR elements in nums2.

nums2.length = 2 (even), so we do not XOR elements in nums1.

Step-by-step:

Since both arrays have even lengths, no elements are XORed. The final XOR is 0.
Copy
Edit
ans1 ^ ans2 = 0 ^ 0 = 0
So, the output is 0.

Time Complexity:
O(N + M) where N is the length of nums1 and M is the length of nums2. We only iterate through each array once when their respective lengths are odd, making this approach efficient.
Conclusion:
This code takes advantage of the properties of the XOR operation and the parity (odd/even) of the lengths of the two input arrays. The key intuition is that when the length of an array is odd, all its elements contribute to the final result, and when the length is even, their contributions cancel out. This allows for an optimized solution that doesn't require constructing the intermediate array nums3.
