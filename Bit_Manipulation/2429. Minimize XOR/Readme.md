Key Points:
Helper Methods:

isSet(num1, bit): Checks if the bit position in num1 is set (1).
isUnSet(num1, bit): Checks if the bit position in num1 is unset (0).
First Pass:

The goal is to match the bits of num1 and x wherever possible, starting from the most significant bit.
This minimizes the XOR result by preserving matching bits.
Second Pass:

If there are still set bits required, fill them in unset positions of num1, starting from the least significant bit.
This ensures we meet the required number of set bits (reqsetbits) while maintaining a minimal XOR value.
Final Result:

The resulting x has the same number of set bits as num2 and minimizes the XOR value with num1.


Greedy Approach for Minimizing XOR:

You want to make x as close as possible to num1 to minimize num1 XOR x. The strategy is:
Start by considering the most significant bit (MSB) and work towards the least significant bit (LSB).
First Pass (Preserving Set Bits from num1):
If a bit in num1 is set (1), prioritize setting that bit in x. This ensures that the XOR at this position is 0, minimizing the XOR.
Second Pass (Filling Unset Bits in num1):
After the first pass, there may still be unset bits in num1. If there are still required set bits (reqsetbits > 0), set those bits in x at the positions where num1 has unset bits (0). This helps distribute the set bits of x in places where it doesn't increase the XOR too much.
