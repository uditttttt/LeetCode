Intuition
The problem revolves around the properties of XOR in binary arrays. XOR has several key properties:


Associative and Commutative: The order of operations does not matter.

Cycle Closure: If a cyclic XOR operation over all elements of an array results in 0, it implies that the array can be reconstructed to form a valid cyclic relationship.

Given the array derived, we need to determine if there exists a binary array original such that the XOR rules hold as described.

Thought Process
Analyzing the Problem:

The derived array is formed by XORing adjacent elements of the original array in a circular manner.
This circular dependency means that the XOR of all elements in derived must satisfy certain properties for a valid original array to exist.
Key Observation:

If the XOR of all elements in derived equals 
0
0, it implies that the circular constraints are consistent, allowing the reconstruction of a valid original array.

Approach
Initialize XOR Variable:

Start with xor = 0.
Iterate Through Derived:

XOR each element of derived with the running total xor.
Check Final XOR:

If the final value of xor is 
0
0, return true (a valid original array exists).
Otherwise, return false (no valid original array can be constructed).
