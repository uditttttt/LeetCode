# Merge Two Sorted 2D Arrays

## Intuition and Thought Process
This code merges two sorted 2D arrays (`nums1` and `nums2`) based on their first element (assumed to be unique identifiers). If an identifier is common in both arrays, their second values are summed up. The result is a merged and sorted 2D array.

---

## Step-by-Step Explanation
### Understanding Input Format
- `nums1` and `nums2` are **sorted 2D arrays**, where each row consists of **two values**:
  - The **first value** is the identifier (sorted in ascending order).
  - The **second value** is the associated quantity/value.
- Example:
  ```java
  nums1 = {{1, 3}, {2, 4}, {5, 6}};  
  nums2 = {{2, 5}, {3, 7}, {5, 8}};
  ```
  Here, `nums1` and `nums2` are sorted based on the **first value** in each subarray.

### Using Two-Pointer Approach
- We maintain two pointers, `i` (for `nums1`) and `j` (for `nums2`), to **iterate through both arrays simultaneously**.
- Since both arrays are **already sorted**, we compare the first values at `nums1[i][0]` and `nums2[j][0]`:
  - If they are **equal**, merge the values by summing the second elements.
  - If `nums1[i][0] < nums2[j][0]`, add `nums1[i]` to the result and move `i` forward.
  - Otherwise, add `nums2[j]` and move `j` forward.

### Handling Remaining Elements
- If any elements are **left in `nums1`**, add them to the result.
- If any elements are **left in `nums2`**, add them to the result.

## Dry Run Example
### Input:
```java
nums1 = {{1, 3}, {2, 4}, {5, 6}};
nums2 = {{2, 5}, {3, 7}, {5, 8}};
```
### Execution Steps:
| Step | i  | j  | nums1[i]  | nums2[j]  | Action |
|------|----|----|----------|----------|--------|
| 1    | 0  | 0  | `{1,3}`  | `{2,5}`  | Add `{1,3}` (nums1 is smaller) |
| 2    | 1  | 0  | `{2,4}`  | `{2,5}`  | Merge `{2,4}` and `{2,5}` â†’ `{2,9}` |
| 3    | 2  | 1  | `{5,6}`  | `{3,7}`  | Add `{3,7}` (nums2 is smaller) |
| 4    | 2  | 2  | `{5,6}`  | `{5,8}`  | Merge `{5,6}` and `{5,8}` â†’ `{5,14}` |
| 5    | 3  | 3  | -        | -        | End (both arrays fully processed) |

### Final Output:
```java
{{1,3}, {2,9}, {3,7}, {5,14}}
```

## Complexity Analysis
### Time Complexity:
- Since we iterate through both arrays **once**, the time complexity is **O(n1 + n2)**.

### Space Complexity:
- The extra space used for `ans` (result list) is **O(n1 + n2)**.

## Key Takeaways
âœ… **Two-pointer technique** efficiently merges sorted arrays.  
âœ… **Merging conditionally** based on common identifiers.  
âœ… **Summing values for common elements** instead of duplicating.  
âœ… **Efficient handling of remaining elements** after the main loop.
