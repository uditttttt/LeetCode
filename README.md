# LeetCode Daily Challenges

Welcome to my LeetCode Daily Challenge repository! Here, I share my solutions to the daily challenges from LeetCode, along with other interesting problems. Each day, I take on a new problem to sharpen my coding skills and push my problem-solving limits. Join me on this journey, and letâ€™s tackle these challenges together!

## What's LeetCode?

LeetCode is a platform for enhancing your programming skills and preparing for technical interviews. They offer a vast collection of coding challenges that range from easy to hard and cover a variety of topics.

## Daily Uploads

I commit to solving and uploading a new problem every day. This practice helps me stay consistent, improve my Java coding skills, and document my progress. Through this repository, I share my thought process and approach to solving these problems.

## Repository Structure

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific problem. Inside, you'll find the following:

- `Solution.java`: My Java implementation for the problem.

## How to Use This Repository

Feel free to browse through the problems and check out my solutions. If you're working on the same problems, compare our approaches and see if you can find any optimizations or alternative methods.

## Contributions

If you have any suggestions or improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request. I'm always looking to improve and would appreciate your input!



Happy coding!
