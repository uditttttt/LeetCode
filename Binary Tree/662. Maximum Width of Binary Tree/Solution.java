/*

ðŸ’¡ Intuition:
We're trying to find the maximum width of a binary tree.

The width of a level is the distance between the leftmost and rightmost non-null nodes in that level.

To calculate width correctly even when tree is sparse, we assign a virtual index to each node as if it were a full binary tree.

For a node at index i, the left child is at 2*i+1, and the right child is at 2*i+2.

Using BFS, we track these indices level by level, and compute width using the difference between first and last indices in that level.
