/*

Intuition Behind the Code:
Why DFS?

We use DFS to traverse all connected 'O' cells starting from the border cells. This helps mark all safe 'O' cells that should not be flipped.
Why do we process border cells first?

Any 'O' connected to a border cannot be surrounded. If we start from these, we can differentiate safe 'O' cells from the ones that need to be flipped.
Why use a vis[][] array?

This array keeps track of safe 'O' cells so that we donâ€™t flip them later.
Final Step: Flipping 'O' to 'X'

Any 'O' cell that is not marked as safe (i.e., not visited) is completely surrounded, so we flip it to 'X'.
Time Complexity:
O(N * M)
Each cell is processed once during DFS, leading to an efficient solution.
This approach ensures that only the required 'O' cells remain unchanged while all enclosed ones are converted to 'X'. ðŸš€
