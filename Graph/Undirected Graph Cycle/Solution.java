Intuition Behind the Code
Graph Traversal: The algorithm uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore all nodes and edges.
Cycle Detection: A cycle in an undirected graph occurs when we encounter a visited node that is not the parent of the current node.
Handling Disconnected Graphs: The isCycle method iterates over all nodes to ensure we check all components.
DFS Recursion: The detectCycleUtil function recursively explores the graph and checks for cycles.
Base Condition for Cycle: If we reach an already visited node that is not our direct parent, a cycle exists.
This method ensures an O(V + E) time complexity, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges, making it efficient for cycle detection in undirected graphs. ðŸš€
