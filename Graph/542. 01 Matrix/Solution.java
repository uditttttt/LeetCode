### **Intuition & Reasoning**
1. **Use of BFS (Breadth-First Search):**  
   - Since we need the shortest distance to the nearest `0`, BFS is the best choice because it explores all neighboring nodes level by level.
   - Unlike DFS (which can go deeper before exploring other nodes), BFS ensures the shortest path is found first.

2. **Initialization:**
   - We first find all `0`s in the matrix and push them into a queue with a distance of `0` because they are already at the nearest `0`.
   - We also mark these cells as visited so they are not processed again.

3. **Processing the Queue (BFS Traversal):**
   - We keep processing the queue, popping an element, and checking its 4 adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).
   - If an adjacent cell is `1` and unvisited, we push it into the queue with a distance `s + 1` and mark it as visited.

4. **Why use a `vis[][]` array?**
   - To prevent reprocessing of cells, which could lead to unnecessary computation.

5. **Why update `dis[][]` inside the loop?**
   - The BFS ensures that the first time a `1` is reached, it is the shortest possible path from a `0`, so we directly store that in `dis[][]`.

### **Complexity Analysis**
- **Time Complexity:** \( O(n \times m) \)  
  - Each cell is processed at most once since it is marked as visited after the first processing.
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(n \times m) \)  
  - The queue can hold at most all elements of the matrix in the worst case.

This approach ensures an efficient and optimal solution using BFS. ðŸš€
