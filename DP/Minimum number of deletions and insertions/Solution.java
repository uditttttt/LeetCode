/*

 ðŸ§  Problem Understanding
Youâ€™re given two strings: s1 and s2.
You want to convert s1 to s2 using only insertions and deletions.

To do that optimally:

Don't change the common parts (LCS)

Remove the rest from s1 â†’ Deletions

Add missing characters from s2 â†’ Insertions

So, the minimum operations =
ðŸ‘‰ deletions + insertions = (len(s1) - LCS) + (len(s2) - LCS)


ðŸ”¥ Intuition Recap
Why LCS?
Because we want to keep as much as possible common between the strings.

Why s1.length() - LCS deletions?
Characters in s1 not in LCS must be deleted.

Why s2.length() - LCS insertions?
Characters in s2 not in LCS must be added.

ðŸ§  Think Like This in Exams
Problem Type? â†’ String transformation using insert/delete.

Observation? â†’ You want to preserve common parts.

Tool? â†’ Use Longest Common Subsequence (LCS).

Rest? â†’ Whateverâ€™s not in LCS = must be inserted/deleted.
