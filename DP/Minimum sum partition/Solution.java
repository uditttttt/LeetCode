üß† Why We Only Go Till s/2
If total sum = S, then we want to minimize |S1 - S2| = |S - 2*S1|.
So the closer S1 is to S/2, the smaller the difference.
Hence, no need to go beyond S/2 ‚Äî after that, differences start increasing again due to symmetry.

Let me know if you'd like a dry run with an example like [1, 6, 11, 5] ‚Äî I can show you exactly how the DP table is filled and how the answer is found.

üí° Key Idea:
If total sum = S, and you divide into subsets S1 and S2, you want to minimize:


|S1 - S2| = |(S1 + S2) - 2*S1| = |S - 2*S1|
So: üëâ Your goal is to find the value of S1 such that |S - 2*S1| is minimized
üëâ But S1 must be a subset sum that is possible from the array
üëâ So we use Subset Sum DP to check which sums are possible

We only check S1 from 0 to S/2, because after that the difference starts increasing again (explained earlier)

üß† Thought Process to Solve in Exam
Recognize it's a partition/subset problem ‚ûù keywords: "divide into 2 subsets", "minimum difference"

Think of total sum S ‚ûù want |S1 - S2| to be minimum ‚ûù leads to |S - 2*S1|

Want to find all S1 such that S1 <= S/2 (as it gives minimum difference)

Use Subset Sum DP to figure out which S1 are possible

Find min(|S - 2*S1|) from those
