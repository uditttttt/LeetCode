ðŸ§  Key Notes for Revision:
This is a counting problem â†’ use + in transitions.

Coin can be used unlimited times â†’ stay on same index when including (dp[i][j - coins[i-1]]).

Base case trick: dp[i][0] = 1 (sum = 0 can always be made by picking nothing).

Table dimension is n+1 x sum+1 to handle base cases cleanly.

ðŸŽ¯ Final Checklist in Exam:
Understand: Are you counting, minimizing, or checking?

Is repetition allowed? (yes â†’ unbounded)

Think of recurrence: include or exclude

Can I convert this to a DP table?

Carefully write base cases and transitions

Code it clearly with dp[i][j] meaning defined
